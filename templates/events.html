		Catalyst IT
	</h3>
	<p> 
		Over the 2015 summer holidays, I participated in the Catalyst IT open source academy. While there, I learnt a whole lot of new things including programming languages (mentioned above), testing, version control, graphic design, accessibility, linux, java, servers, and using the famous vi/vim. I also got to contribute to Piwik - an open source web analytics program - and I currently have the first and only theme available on the piwik marketplace (129 downloads and counting).
