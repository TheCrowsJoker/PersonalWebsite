		About me
	</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Liam Sharpe. I have a keen interest in computer science and one day hope to be a computer programmer. I have programming skills in many languages including; python, HTML, CSS, and PHP. I also have experience working with linux servers, and since being introduced to git, i will never start a project without using version control.

		Over the 2015 summer holidays, i participated in the Catalyst IT open source academy. While there, I learnt a whole lot of new things including programming languages (mentioned above), testing, version control, graphic design, accessibility, linux, java, servers, and using the famous vi/vim. I also got to contribute to Piwik - an open source web analytics program - and i currently have the first and only theme available on the piwik marketplace (112 downloads and counting).
